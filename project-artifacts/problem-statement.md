# Problem Statement

In today's financial landscape, individuals require a modern solution to manage their expenses
effectively. Traditional financial tracking methods like manual spreadsheets often lack the sophistication
and real-time insights necessary to make informed decisions.

As a result, there is a need for a centralized financial tracking system that offers income tracking,
expense management, bill management, savings goal creation, and insightful analytics.

The system will be a web-based application and an easy-to-navigate user interface. Users can input
multiple sources of income and track various expenses with different categories, such as rent, groceries,
entertainment, and more, each with allocated funds.

Users can set up recurring bills and receive timely reminders before the due date. They will also have the
option to mark bills as paid, converting them into recorded expenses.

Additionally, users can create saving goals with monthly saving percentages. However, the system will
ensure that the total percentage of all active savings does not exceed 100%.

The system will feature an intuitive insight dashboard that consolidates key financial metrics such as total
income, expenses, upcoming bills, savings progress, and a graphical representation of monthly income and expenses.

This centralized platform will empower users with actionable insights to optimize their financial health
and achieve their goals efficiently.
